A New Dog to Sign Up for the app

1. Will require a button in the top right if not logged in, says "Sign Up"
2. Sign Up page with standard page look, but offers username, email, and password options
3. Button to "create account", used to submit the information and start the creation process
4. If successful, the dog will be taken directly to their newly created account profile.

How to friend and accept other Dogs

1. Similar to snapchat, once logged in, there will be a magnifying glass (search button) in the top right on the home page
2. This button will take you to a larger search bar asking for a username
3. All accounts with said username will show up, which includes their profile picture and their bio
4. Button on the right to send friend request
5. For ease of processing, the dog who was sent a request will see the notification as a popup over their home page - whenever they log in again.
6. This pop up will offer the option to deny or accept the friend request

Location notification - rough idea

1. Since we already know that the app will be tracking your location on your phone at all times anyways, why don't we implement this?
2. Your location will be compared to those who you have friend requested
3. If your location and a friend's location is 10 meters or less in distance, you will both receive a notification
4. A pop up will appear in the app with the words "Your friend, {friend_name}, is nearby!"
